# Hi there, my name is Ramazan Kozhabayev!ðŸ‘‹

## Some work-related info-stuff about me!

I code! Not sure what exactly, haven't chosen it yet... but currently experimenting with the Three Basics (HTML5, CSS3, JS)!
... That depends if you consider them to be *real* languages, of course!
- ### Things currently underway:
- Continue learning to code!
- Perhaps make my first *real* website, even if it's static.
